This is a straightforward and simple version, so Iâ€™m sharing the complete code with you.
However, I noticed that the scroll animation could use improvement.
I recommend learning more about it or reaching out to me for guidance. Additionally,
I suggest incorporating creative 3D elements for moving components to enhance the overall design.
Thank you!
